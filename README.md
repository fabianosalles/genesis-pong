# genesis-pong
A simple pong game clone for Sega Genesis using SGDK


# building
I'm using windows to build this project so, you'll need an windows based SGDK installation. You also need the gens emulator.

Make sure there is a `SGDK` environment var pointing to a valid SGDK installation path and a `GENS` environment var pointing to gens emulator install path.

Just run the [build.bat](./build.bat) file and, youl should see the game running on gens.
